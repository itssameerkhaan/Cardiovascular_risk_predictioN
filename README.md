**Congenital heart disease** is one or more problems with the heart's structure that exist since birth. Congenital means that you're born with the condition. Congenital heart disease in adults and children can change the way blood flows through the heart.
There are many different types of congenital heart defects. This article focuses on congenital heart disease in adults.
Some types of congenital heart disease may be mild. But complex defects may cause life-threatening complications. However, advances in diagnosis and treatment continue to improve survival for those with congenital heart disease.
People with congenital heart disease need lifelong medical care. Treatment may include regular checkups (watchful waiting), medications or surgery. If you have adult congenital heart disease, ask your health care provider how often you need a checkup.
An Organized Dataset of individuals had been selected Keeping in mind their history of heart problems and in accordance with other medical conditions. Heart disease are the diverse conditions by which the heart is affected. According to World Health Organization (WHO), the greatest number of deaths in middle aged people are due to Cardiovascular diseases. We take a data source which is comprised of medical history of 3390 different patient of different age groups. This dataset gives us the much-needed information i.e. the medical attributes such as age, resting blood pressure, fasting sugar level etc. of the patient that helps us in detecting the patient that is diagnosed with any heart disease or not. This dataset contains 17 medical attributes of 3390 patients that helps us detecting if the patient is at risk of getting a heart disease or not and it helps us classify patients that are at risk of having a heart disease and that who are not at risk.

* Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the major cause of mortality worldwide. According to WHO, 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, accounting for 32% of all global fatalities.
* Though CVDs cannot be treated, predicting the risk of the disease and taking the necessary precautions and medications can help to avoid severe symptoms and, in some cases, even death.
* As a result, it is critical that we accurately predict the risk of heart disease in order to avert as many fatalities as possible.
